Show multiple Likes Counter on your website. You can set: Facebook page (or id), cache duration, offset, separator and tag around each character.

== Description ==

Likes Counter gets Facebook Likes of any page you want and stores the returning value temporarily in database so it doesn't bubble requests to Facebook API.

Benefits:

1. You can use Likes Counter multiple times in the same code.

2. After the cache duration expires, it will make a new request and update the Likes value, again for the duration set.

3. This plugin stores its values with [Transients API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API 'Transients API'), so it can be cachable outside database with memcached plugins. I recommend using [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/ 'W3 Total Cache').

4. Easy to style span tags with css classes *likes-counter* and *likes-counter-separator*.

I made this plugin to be as light as possible, so I ended up making a shortcode that gives the user the functionality to build a powerful Facebook Likes Counter.

= Usage =

You can place it anywhere in your post/page with [likescounter page='*page_name_or_id*'] shortcode.

**Example:**

SHORTCODE IN POST/PAGE:

> [likescounter page='WordPress' duration='30' offset='10' separator='dot' tag='true']

-- Gets *842488* likes from Wordpress Facebook page,

-- Caches the value for 30 minutes,

-- Offsets likes count by 10: *842478*,

-- Adds a thousand dot separator: *842.478*,

-- Adds a span tag around each character.

    Returns : <span class="likes-counter">8</span>
              <span class="likes-counter">4</span>
              <span class="likes-counter">2</span>
              <span class="likes-counter-separator">.</span>
              <span class="likes-counter">4</span>
              <span class="likes-counter">7</span>
              <span class="likes-counter">8</span>

CSS:

Now lets add some CSS inside *style.css* of your active Theme:

    span.likes-counter {
    	background-color: #eeeeee;
    	border-bottom: 1px solid #aaaaaa;
    	border-left: 1px solid #cccccc;
    	border-radius: 5px;
    	border-right: 1px solid #dddddd;
    	border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;
    	color: #1e8cbe;
    	margin: 2px;
    	padding: 5px 10px;
    }
    
    span.likes-counter-separator {
    	color: #dddddd;
    	padding: 2px 4px;
    }

PHP:

If you need to use inside a Theme Template file, use [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode 'do_shortcode'):

    <?php echo do_shortcode( '[likescounter page="page_name_or_id"]' ); ?>

= Attributes =

*   **page (string):** facebook page name (ex: wordpress) or id (ex: 6427302910)
*   **duration (1 to 1440 - default: 30):** duration in minutes to cache in database before making a new request.
*   **offset (0 to number of current likes - default: 0):** subtracts from Likes value and returns the rest. It can be used to reset likes count for a Likes goal objective in marketing campaigns.
*   **separator (dot, comma, short, space or none - default: none):** thousand separator type. Short separator, shortens thousand to K, million to M and billion to B.
*   **tag (true or false - default: true):** span tag around each character for css styling. `<span class="likes-counter">number_character</span>` for number characters and `<span class="likes-counter-separator">separator_character</span>` for separators characters.

= Important =

> Could not get likes data. Please verify if page is correct.

If you get this there are two possible reasons:

 - Page / id misspelled or doesn't exist (most likely),
 - Couldn't connect to Facebook Graph API or Timeout. It may happen if you reach Facebook policy limits, consider increasing cache duration.
